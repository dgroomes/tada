‚èØ Demo Android application.

## Overview

Let's learn and explore Android with a toy/demo application.

I wrote this about 5 years ago and only now (2020) I'm adding a README and reviving this
project! I'd like to brush up on my Android knowledge and learn the new features and idioms. UPDATE:
got the project to build and run! Wow I'm amazed, impressed and thankful to the Android team for
letting this five year old project build in Android Studio without any source code changes at all!
In particular, I'm surprised that Android Studio allows a project using Gradle 3.3 and using the
Android Gradle plugin with version 2.3.1. I thought new releases of Android Studio required new
versions of the Android Gradle plugin? The backwards-compatibility story is much better than I
remembered.

## Notes

Use the command line to start the app in the attached device or emulator with:
```
adb shell am start -n "us.mn.dgtc.tada/us.mn.dgtc.tada.activity.HomeActivity"
```

## Wish List

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* DONE Upgrade to latest version of Dagger
* DONE Upgrade to latest version of the Android Gradle plugin
* DONE Upgrade to latest version of Gradle
* DONE Upgrade to latest version of Kotlin. (There's an overarching theme of "upgrade everything"! The
  Android development toolchain has tight coupling of the versions of these things. So, I have to
  find the right order to upgrade the versions of these dependencies. I would prefer to
  incrementally upgrade them and always stay within reach of a working codebase instead of trying
  the "roll the dice" approach of upgrading everything all at once and then scratching my head for
  an indeterminate amount of time as I get vague and complex build errrors (e.g 50+ line Gradle
  stacktraces, or internal errors in AAPT, or Dagger code generation problems especially with regard
  to Kotlin... I've been down this road before and I don't want to revisit it if I can help it!)
* Use Gradle's JVM toolchain support to use latest Java (15 right now) for the Gradle process but
  use Java 8 for the project itself (I doubt this would work)
* DONE Use Gradle's Kotlin DSL (UPDATE: implementing this was not a wise choice. Android does not explicitly support
  this. If they did support it, then they would have documentation about it. They do not have documentation. It's up to
  you to read blog posts about how to do this. What's more, is that Goodl does not publish the correct plugin metadata
  for the Android Gradle plugin. This makes it harder to figure out how to use. See the extensive notes in the very
  thorough official Gradle documentation (thank you Gradle for good docs and many examples) https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html#sec:multi_project_builds_applying_plugins
  Furhtermore, "kapt" is not resolving for me in Android Studio, and it keeps suggesting some import (which is wrong).
  Gradle's Kotlin DSL *is not* recommended for Android projects.
* DONE Upgrade to latest versions of test dependencies (yikes, there are a lot of independent testing
  components, each with their own versioning:
    * `com.android.support.test:runner` (currently version 0.5)
    * `com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core` (currently version 2.2.2)
    * `com.android.support.test.uiautomator:uiautomator-v18` (currently version 2.1.2, that's close though...)
* DONE Remove Anko because it's deprecated and unsupported
* DONE Upgrade to Android X
* DONE Upgrade to latest Android X


## Reference Material

* [Android official site: Android Build Tools release notes](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/build-tools)
* [Android official site: Android Gradle plugin release notes](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin)
* [Maven central: versions of Kotlin Stdlib](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin/kotlin-stdlib)
  * I occasionally try to find the release notes of Kotlin and there is no browsable list in either the Kotlin official
    site or in GitHub because there 20,000+ GitHub releases for Kotlin. That's not browsable. I finally figured out I
    can look in Maven Central to find the complete list of released version of Kotlin. Thanks Maven Central!

* [Google Maven Repository](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html?q=com.android.support.test#com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core)
  * This is useful just like Maven Central is useful. It's source of truch for released versions of software
    components.
