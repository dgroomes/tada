⏯ Demo Android application.

### Overview

Let's learn and explore Android with a toy/demo application.

I wrote this about 5 years ago and only now (2020) I'm adding a README and reviving this
project! I'd like to brush up on my Android knowledge and learn the new features and idioms. UPDATE:
got the project to build and run! Wow I'm amazed, impressed and thankful to the Android team for
letting this five year old project build in Android Studio without any source code changes at all!
In particular, I'm surprised that Android Studio allows a project using Gradle 3.3 and using the
Android Gradle plugin with version 2.3.1. I thought new releases of Android Studio required new
versions of the Android Gradle plugin? The backwards-compatibility story is much better than I
remembered.
